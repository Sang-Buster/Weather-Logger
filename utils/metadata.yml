columns:
  - name: tNow
    description: Timestamp of the data record
    unit: datetime
    data_type: datetime

  - name: u_m_s
    description: Wind speed component in the x-direction
    unit: meters per second
    data_type: float

  - name: v_m_s
    description: Wind speed component in the y-direction
    unit: meters per second
    data_type: float

  - name: w_m_s
    description: Wind speed component in the z-direction
    unit: meters per second
    data_type: float

  - name: 2dSpeed_m_s
    description: Total wind speed in the horizontal plane (2D vector magnitude of u and v)
    unit: meters per second
    data_type: float

  - name: 3DSpeed_m_s
    description: Total wind speed (3D vector magnitude of u, v, and w)
    unit: meters per second
    data_type: float

  - name: Azimuth_deg
    description: Wind direction in the horizontal plane
    unit: degrees
    range: 0 to 360
    data_type: float
    notes:
      - "Measured clockwise from north"
      - "0° indicates wind is coming from the north"
      - "90° indicates wind is coming from the east"
      - "180° indicates wind is coming from the south"
      - "270° indicates wind is coming from the west"

  - name: Elev_deg
    description: Elevation angle of the wind vector
    unit: degrees
    range: -60 to 60
    data_type: float
    notes:
      - "Positive values indicate wind is coming from above the horizontal plane (downdraft)"
      - "Negative values indicate wind is coming from below the horizontal plane (updraft)"
      - "Effective elevation angle measurements are limited to ±60.0°."

  - name: Press_Pa
    description: Atmospheric pressure
    unit: Pascals
    data_type: float

  - name: Temp_C
    description: Air temperature
    unit: degrees Celsius
    data_type: float

  - name: Hum_RH
    description: Relative humidity
    unit: percentage
    range: 0 to 100
    data_type: float

  - name: SonicTemp_C
    description: Sonic temperature (derived from speed of sound)
    unit: degrees Celsius
    data_type: float

  - name: Error
    description: Error value from the Anemometer
    unit: meters per second
    notes:
      - "Non-zero values indicate unreliable data for that row"
      - "Corresponds to the u_m_s value when an error occurs"
    data_type: float

notes:
  - "Wind components (u, v, w) follow meteorological convention: positive u is eastward wind, positive v is northward wind, positive w is upward wind"
  - "Azimuth_deg is measured clockwise from north"
